- All collections with latest 5 entries
- Available pages/routes
- Environment information

### Development Mode
- OTPs are displayed in console and browser
- Email sending fallback to console logging

## Database Schema

### Key Relationships
```
Customer 1:N Address
Customer 1:N PickupRequest
PickupRequest 1:N Bid
Raddiwala 1:N Bid
Raddiwala 1:1 Address (shop)
Raddiwala 1:N Subscription
PickupRequest 1:1 CompletedTransaction
```

### Business Logic
- Customers can have max 3 addresses
- Pickup requests can have max 5 photos
- Raddiwalas can place unlimited bids if premium OR <50 monthly pickups
- Monthly pickup counter resets on 1st of each month
- Premium subscription costs â‚¹30/month
- Both parties can rate each other after completed transactions
